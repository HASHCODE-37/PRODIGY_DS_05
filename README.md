Task 05: Traffic Accident Analysis
This Python script, part of my Prodigy InfoTech internship, analyzes synthetic traffic accident data. It generates data for road conditions, weather, time of day, accident locations, and severity. Using pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn, it:

Explores road and weather distributions.
Identifies accident hotspots.
Analyzes accidents by hour.
Studies road condition impact on severity.
Clone the repo.
Install required libraries.
Run traffic_accident_analysis.py.
Explore insights on traffic accidents.
Note: Replace synthetic data with real data for actual analysis.
